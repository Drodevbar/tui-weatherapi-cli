## Development

Requirements:
* `Docker` && `docker-compose`

Running the project:
* _ensure Docker Daemon is running_
* `cp .env.example .env`
* _fill out all environmental variables inside `.env`_
* `docker-compose up`

Brief information:
* project uses PHP 8.0 so expect some new features inside _(yay!)_
* code is divided into 2 separate directories: `src` and `tests` - check them out!
